### 1.2. Solution Profile  

#### 1.2.1. Background and Problem Statement  

###### Background
<p align="justify">
  In the current context, inventory management has become a priority for many businesses that face challenges such as stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficient processes. However, most companies lack accessible, intuitive, and effective tools to properly track and manage their inventory. Although there are applications on the market, many are complex, poorly customizable, or do not offer real-time data and active guidance to improve inventory management.
</p>

###### Problem Statement (5Ws and 2Hs)

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">What: What's the problem?</h5>   

* Many businesses struggle to efficiently manage their inventory, leading to stockouts, overstocking, and wasted resources, which prevents them from optimizing operations and meeting customer demand.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">Where: Where does the problem arise?</h5>  

* The problem arises in the daily operations of businesses, especially in warehouses, stockrooms, and supply chains, where there is no real-time tracking or efficient tools to monitor inventory levels.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">Why: Why can't they manage their inventory well?</h5>  

* The lack of advanced inventory management systems, poor integration with other business processes, and reliance on manual tracking methods lead to errors, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">When: When does the problem occur?</h5>  

* The problem occurs during the procurement process, when tracking inventory levels, or when trying to forecast demand, leading to either excess stock or stockouts.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">Who: Who is involved?</h5>  

* Business owners, warehouse managers, and supply chain teams, particularly in small to medium-sized enterprises that do not have access to robust enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">How: How do you manage your inventory now?</h5>  

* Most businesses use outdated methods such as spreadsheets, manual logs, or basic software that does not provide real-time data or integrate seamlessly with other operational systems.

<h5 style="color: #000; font-size: .9rem">How much: How much do they lose due to poor inventory management?</h5>  

* It is estimated that businesses lose between 10% and 30% of their potential revenue due to stockouts, overstocking, and inefficiencies in managing their inventory.

#### 1.2.2. Lean UX Process  

##### 1.2.2.1. Lean UX Problem Statements  
<p align="justify">
The current state of inventory management relies on disorganized and traditional methods such as spreadsheets, manual logs, or generic applications. These solutions do not provide efficient control or actionable data that allows businesses to optimize their inventory, leading to stockouts, overstocking, and wasted resources.
</p>  

<p align="justify">
The problem lies in the lack of an accessible and personalized tool that combines simplicity with advanced features, such as real-time tracking, automatic stock alerts, and detailed reporting on inventory trends. Businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, need a platform that integrates seamlessly into their daily operations and helps them make informed decisions about their inventory.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Our product, StockPulse, will address this gap through an easy-to-use platform that offers features such as real-time stock updates, inventory forecasting, and interactive dashboards to help businesses monitor and optimize their inventory management.
</p>

<p align="justify">
We’ll know we’ve been successful when we see increasing adoption of the platform, with an increase in monthly retention rate and a customer satisfaction (CSAT) score above 90%.
</p>

##### 1.2.2.2. Lean UX Assumptions  

###### Business Assumptions  
1. There is a growing market of businesses interested in digital inventory management tools.  
2. Businesses are willing to invest in applications that help them optimize their inventory processes and improve operational efficiency.  
3. An intuitive and accessible design will attract more users and reduce the learning curve.  
4. Artificial intelligence can enhance the value proposition by providing predictive analytics and personalized inventory recommendations.  

###### User Assumptions  
5. Users prefer tools that can be customized according to their inventory management needs and business goals.  
6. They want actionable insights and clear visualizations about their inventory trends and stock levels.  
7. They value the ability to receive alerts for low stock levels or overstocking situations.  
8. They need mobile and accessible solutions that integrate seamlessly into their daily operations.  

###### Business Outcome Assumptions  
* Achieve a 75% renewal rate of subscription plans every month.  
* The app will generate revenue through a freemium model, with advanced features available via subscriptions.  
* User adoption and retention will depend on ease of use and perceived value.  
* A high retention rate will indicate the success of the AI-driven and personalization-focused approach.  
* Achieve a 90% customer satisfaction score (CSAT).  

###### User Outcome Assumptions  
* Users will improve their inventory management processes and optimize stock levels.  
* They will feel more in control and efficient in managing their inventory.  
* They will save time and reduce errors by using an all-in-one inventory management tool.  

###### Features  
* Easy input of inventory data with real-time updates and automatic categorization.  
* Adjustable to the user's specific inventory management needs and business habits.  
* Interactive dashboards to identify inventory trends and stock levels.  
* Notifications when stock levels are low or when inventory thresholds are close to being exceeded.
